wow i can also hook it up to an AI API or even connect all of it to a Clawdbot/moltbot and some motors and sensors and stuff! 
i can also use the ESP32 to send myself emails and stuff.


but this way i can aslo store and rearrange or save data or send data.

like for my workout thing it can make a telegram bot chat that can save all their previous workout data and stuff as an easy way to access it without accessing its wifi or 
visiting an IP addess page or something, but it still wont be able to connect to wifi in that way.

maybe it can be cause if i setup the server on the ESP32 then i wont have access to it so people can put in their wifi and password and i wont have access to it! 
epic! 
or even other programs and stuff.

i can set it that whenever theres a sensor read like someones walking or water low or wind speed or weather API or anything else it can just telegram send me a message.
i can ask it to telegram send me a new zip code for it to update its weatherometer, or send and save calandarometer notifications.
or just do general things.
but yeah generally just wayy easier notifications than any other way of remote sensor readouts.
or even bug reports or even just general progressess.

I can also use it to controll a motor or a servo motor or the sailboat thing or even chatgpt thing
or anything
